# Reproducible Workflow

## The Claerbout Principle

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.

[Buckheit \& Donoho, 1995](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf)

## Organizing Principles  
Christensen, Miguel & Freese (2018)  

1 - Use code (scripts), don't work by hand (Excel/spreadsheet).  
2 - Consider not saving statistical output, and just saving the code and raw data that generates it.  
3 - Reproducibility--on your own machine across multiple runs, across machines, across researchers.   

## File Management \& Coding Suggestions
Begin with a logical file structure

# Version Control

## Git/Github for Version Control 
- Git and Github are tools to track the complete history of your files.   

- They are very popular among programmers, but not so much among non-programmers. 
- Why? I believe it has to do with GUIs.

## What is a GUI and why the bad reputaion

**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

- For most of us (non-programmers): $GUI = Software$.  

- GUIs are behind the popularization of personal computers. 

- Unfortunatley GUIs are pretty bad at keeping a record of actions taken (bad for reproducibility).

## What is not a GUI?
- Any software that is run in the command line (aka terminal, shell, bash, etc).  

\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in]{../Images/command_line.png}
  
- Git was designed to run in the command line.

- Today we will learn Git **without** the commmand line.

## What is Git 1/2

- Git is a software designed to track the **entire** history of the code of a project. 

- Designed originally for software development, it has gained important traction in the research community. 

- Main appeal: facilitates full reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Git is mainly meant to work as a non-GUI (in the commmand line) software.   
**However:** most of the key features can be used through a GUI. 

## What is Git 2/2

- By code git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- This types of files can be understood as "human readable" as machine and human see the same fie. 

- Files that are "non-human readable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can also detect changes in binary files, but it cannot show those changes.

## What is Github
- Github is a company that provides two services (that we care of): 
  - A web hosting service for all our files track with git (public free/private $ or free if academic).  
  - A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to git.

- Others hosting ss include: Bitbucket, GitLab, Gitkraken, etc. 

- Other GUIs include: SourceTree, Gitkraken, Atom, RStudio.

## The Primary Goal of Version Control (for us)

**The Goal:** keep track of any potentially meaningful modification to your code.  
\pause  
**Secondary Goal:** Learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   

\pause  
**Bonus track:** get you excited about using open source statistical software (R, Python, Julia, etc)

## Strategy 1:  
1 - Agree on a naming convention with you co-authors (eg: YYYYMMDDfilename_INITALS).  
2 - Begin working from the last saved version (eg: `20180325demo_FH.do`).  
3 - At the end of the day, save on a new version (eg: `20180327demo_FH.do`).  

**Pros:** Easy adoption.   

**Cons:** Error prone, hard to document, lots of files for each document.     
  
  
## Strategy 2:  
1 - Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`)  
2 - Take a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change (day, hour or minutes).  
3 - Update your entire working folder to the cloud.   


**Pros:** Error proof, seamless documentation, one file per document, track differences across all versions, meant to work with the cloud. 

**Cons:** Harder adoption.   

## We want to avoid this situation:

## Other reasons to use git

- To access a whole new world of knowledge!    
- Great tool for collaboration.  
- Easier to test all sorts of ideas/models.

# Demos

## Three Demos: 

1 - **Simple but instructive.**   

2 - Repeat but with a slightly more fun example. Collaborate.
 
3 - Repeat with a real-life example.   


## Demo #1: We Start in the Cloud 

1-  Create [github.com](github.com) account and sign in.   
2-  Let's look at some **repos**.   
3-  First way to access content: download.   
4-  What if you want to have your own copy of the repo? **Fork** it!.  
5-  Now create your own repo. Initiate readme and make some edits.   

## Demo #1: We move to our local computer 

6- Clone the it. Explore the files and location.   
7- Create new files, edit. And commit. Edit again, and commit again.   
8- Push. Edit on github.com, and pull.   
9- Simulate conflict (between local and remote) and start from a fresh copy!  
10- For this tutorial, best way to access previous version: explore in github.com and download.


## Three Demos: 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    *Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete & restart, search repo, download old version.*   
2 - **Repeat but with a slightly more fun example. Collaborate.**
    
3 - Repeat with a real-life example.   
    
    
## Demo #2: Branches and collaboration

1- Create a branch from previus repo.  
2- Add new content, commit a few times and merge.  
3- Go back to main branch (master), observe file, merge.  
4- Repeat 1-3 but now replace instead of adding content.    
 

## Demo #2: Branches and collaboration 

5- Fork repo `github.com/BITSS/test2`, and clone it into your machine.  
6- Edit fields of name, and birth date.   
7- Save, commit and push.   
8- Create your first Pull Request.   
9- Let's see if I can manage all those pull requests very quickly.     
10- Create a new repo, invite a collaborator, edit, commit, push/pull.

## Three Demos: 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete & restart, search repo, download old version.   
2 - Repeat but with a slightly more fun example. Collaborate.
    *Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts, collaborate: same proj, fork model+PR*
    .  
3 - **Repeat with a real-life example.**   
    
## Demo #3: Look inside a half-way project (and collaborate!)

Description:   

- Half baked project, forgoten from a few years.    
- Exploratory analysis of publication trends in NBER working paper series. Back then inspired by a paper from [DellaVigna and Card](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/CardDellaVignaTop5PapersJEL2013.pdf).  
- Now there is more literature around this: [Chari and Goldsmith-Pinkham](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23953).   

- I will use github to share my work with you, do a little excercise, and invite you to collaborate. 
    
## Demo #3: Look inside a half-way project (and collaborate!)

1-  Find the following repo: `github.com/fhoces/nber_trends`.   
2-  Fork it and clone it.    
3-  Open it in your computer, look around and try to execute some parts.  
4-  Generate random number like this: `num1 = sample(20000, 1)`.  
5-  Look the name and (imputed) gender of the author in row `num1`.  
6-  Create the following line at the end of the script: `verification = (num1, author, gender, correct(1 yes, 0 no) )`.  
7-  Save, commit, push and create a pull request.  
8-  Feel free to look around create more contributions if you like. Happy to co-author.

2 - Repeat but with a slightly more fun example. Collaborate.
    Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts, collaborate: same proj, fork model+PR
    .  
3 - Repeat with a real-life example.  
    *Review: All of the above, plus: how does a real-life example looks like.* 


## Now go and explore!
Some good habits:   
- Commit often (<1hr)  
- Always pull before you start a new session of work. Also good to pull before pushing.    
- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.
