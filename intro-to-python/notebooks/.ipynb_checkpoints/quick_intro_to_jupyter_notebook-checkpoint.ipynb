    "Jupyter Notebook App (formerly IPython Notebook) is an application running inside the browser.\n",
    "Notebook documents (or “notebooks”, all lower case) are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis. And thats what make them powerful and cool."

    "### The Jupyter Notebook App\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as we are doing here) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to displaying/editing/running notebook documents, the Jupyter Notebook App has a “Dashboard” (Notebook Dashboard) with title **home** which acts as a “control panel” showing local files and allowing to open notebook documents or shutting down their kernels."

    "A notebook kernel is a “computational engine” that executes the code contained in a Notebook document. The ipython kernel, referenced in this guide, executes python code. Kernels for many other languages exist (official kernels). Also, while here we are running Python 3 Kernel, you can also run Python 2 Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a Notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. When the notebook is executed (either cell-by-cell or with menu Cell -> Run All), the kernel performs the computation and produces the results. "

The Notebook Dashboard has other features similar to a file manager such as navigating folders."

    "The easiest way to install the Jupyter Notebook App is installing a scientific python distribution which also includes other common data science and scientific python packages. This is what we did by installing Anaconda. If you are more experienced, you can install each component separately (i.e install Python and then install Jupyter Notebook)"

We will look at a fe key concepts about running a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
